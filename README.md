# Star Wars Planets

## Overview
This project implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API in Django to interact with data retrieved from an external GraphQL endpoint. The goal is to fetch data from the Star Wars API GraphQL endpoint, store it in a local database, and provide endpoints to manage this data.
